# odin-recipes

Welcome to Odin Recipes! This is a simple project where you can find various recipes and their details.

## Description

This project is organized into iterations, each adding new features to the website.

### Iteration 1: Initial Structure

Within the `odin-recipes` directory, an `index.html` file is created with the basic HTML structure. 


### Iteration 2: Recipe Page

A new directory named `recipes` is created within the `odin-recipes` directory. Inside, a new HTML file is created for each recipe. Links to these recipe pages are added to the `index.html` file.

### Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content

Each recipe page includes:
- An image of the finished dish
- A description of the recipe
- An ingredients list
- Steps for making the dish

### Iteration 4: Add More Recipes

Two additional recipes are added, following the same page structure as the initial recipe. Links to these new recipes are added to the index page, possibly organized within an unordered list for better readability.

## How to Use

To use this project, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. From there, you can navigate to different recipes and view their details.
